I would like to be considered for the position of \jobtitle. I believe I have the
desired skills and could be a valuable asset to \company, as you can see on my CV attached.

I have large experience with web services and object oriented programming, specially with Python -- a language I've
been using for the past 8 years, both academically and professionally --, Flask and Django.

I have a degree in Computer Sciences and an unfinished Masters in Computer Sciences. I was involved with scientific research
during the period of both degrees, which gave me a great deal of experience using algorithms to solve
non-trivial problems, like graph algorithms applied to networks and distributed services, since this was
my field of research.

If you need any more specific information, I will be glad to provide it. You can find a complete historic on my
professional experience on the CV attached. Please contact me to schedule an interview.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

I look forward to your reply.
